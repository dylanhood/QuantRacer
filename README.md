## News

<details><summary><mark><font color=darkened>### Version 1.0 release (Alpha):</font></mark></summary>
  <div>&emsp;</div>
&emsp; • This version may be actively and/or inactively in progress.
<br><br>

<b>WARNING:</b> This is not an official QuantRacer release. Use at your own risk.
<br></br>
This is an early-access view into the development of the web/mobile application, currently, titled "QuantRacer".
</details>

## Description

A web application developed by, possibly, using statistics and/or smart algorithm(s) in an attempt towards creating a more personalized approach towards improving mental math calculations (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fraction(s), percentage(s), sequence(s), pos/neg, etc.). Designed towards becoming more advanced as you improve to, possibly, train muscle memory.
<br></br>
TL;DR: Basically, it's kind of like I'm trying to mix some feature(s) from Keybr, Arithmetic Zetamac, Tradermath, Rankyourbrain, RFQJobs, graduateTrader, etc. into one web/mobile application.
<br></br>
What is Keybr? https://www.keybr.com/
<br></br>
What is Arithmetic Zetamac? https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/
<br></br>
What is Tradermath? https://www.tradermath.org/
<br></br>
What is Rankyourbrain? https://rankyourbrain.com/mental-math
<br></br>
What is RFQJobs? https://rfqjobs.com/
<br></br>
What is graduateTrader? https://graduatetrader.com/


## Installation

The web application should be available at the link below.

``` bash
www.insertwebsitelinkforthissection.com
(maybe quantracer.com)
```

The mobile application may be realeased on the Google Play Store (and maybe other store(s)) at a later date.
