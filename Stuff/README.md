# Quantitative Trading Speed Math Application
# Keybr Version of Zetamac
A web tool developed by, possibly, using statistics and/or smart algorithm(s) in an attempt towards creating a more personalized approach towards improving mental math calculations (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fraction(s), percentage(s), sequence(s), pos/neg, etc.). Designed towards becoming more advanced as you improve to, possibly, train muscle memory.
<br></br>
<h1> Maybe Step 1: </h1>
<br></br>
<b> Maybe create the front page UI, first to add screenshot(s) and stuff (for résumé, and/or portfolio website, and/or README.md) </b>
<br><br>
<b> Also, maybe use link(s) like (https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/releases?page=459), (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/), and (https://semver.org/), etc. for guidance on release(s) and/or documentation (maybe, also, use the other GitHub repo(s) from the Stars section in your profile). </b>
<br><br>
<b> Also, maybe take this README.md file out of this repository and maybe put it somewhere else (like maybe on the laptop, or Gmail, or Outlook, or in another repository, etc.).<b>

<br></br>
<b> Addition Feature:</b> (Ex: 4 + 8, 4 + 80, 4 + 800, 4 + 8000, 40 + 80, 40 + 800, 40 + 8000, 400 + 800, 400 + 8000, 4000 + 8000)
<br></br>
<b> Subtraction Feature: </b> (Ex: 4 - 8, 4 - 80, 4 - 800, 4 - 8000, 40 - 80, 40 - 800, 40 - 8000, 400 - 800, 400 - 8000, 4000 - 8000)
<br></br>
<b> Multiplication Feature: </b>  (Ex: 4 × 8, 4 × 80, 4 × 800, 4 × 8000, 40 × 80, 40 × 800, 40 × 8000, 400 × 800, 400 × 8000, 4000 × 8000)
<br></br>
<b> Division Feature: </b> (Ex: 4 ÷ 8, 4 ÷ 80, 4 ÷ 800, 4 ÷ 8000, 40 ÷ 80, 40 ÷ 800, 40 ÷ 8000, 400 ÷ 800, 400 ÷ 8000, 4000 ÷ 8000)
<br></br>
<b> Position Changes Feature: </b> (Ex: Positive and/or Negative?)
<br></br>
<b> Decimal Feature: </b> (Ex: 4.8, 48.4, 484.8, 4848.4, 4.84, 4.848, 4.8484)
<br></br>
<b> Fraction Feature: </b> (Ex: ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅕, ⅙, ¾, ⅞, etc.)
<br></br>
<b> Mixed Fraction Feature: </b> (Ex: 4½, 17⅓, 800¼, etc.)
<br></br>
<b> Sequence Feature: </b> (Ex: 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, ?. Here the missing term is 127. The pattern between the numbers can be given by Zi = 2*(Zi - 1) + 1, where Z represents the corresponding term in the sequence. [In order to solve some of the sequences you should have a learn how to solve sequences using the difference method. This will vastly speed up your time and accuracy.])
<br></br>
<b>  </b>
<br></br>
<b>  </b>
<br></br>
<b> Optiver Exam Feature: Optiver 80 in 80 exam. </b>
<br></br>
<b> Overview Feature: </b> This is a page with detailed statistics about your learning progress. The more lessons you complete, the more detailed and accurate these statistics will be [Maybe Include: Total Time Spent Playing, Total Number Of Practice Session(s), Total Number of Test(s), Hard Top Score, Medium Top Score, Easy Top Score, Relative Arithmetic/Mental Math Top Speed For Easy, Medium, Hard, (Maybe take the top score(s) of every user and make a histogram or histograph (there is a difference between the two) chart containing the discrete data (and show what percentile they are for each level of difficulty) ]
<br></br>
<b> ⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆ Maybe a, possible, additional add ⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆ <b>
(Maybe create an "Overall Rank" to add to the Overview Feature) [Maybe it takes the test performance(s) and divdes them into one score (maybe it weight(s) the difficulty {i.e. 50% for Hard, 40% for Medium, 10% for Easy} or maybe it doesn't), maybe the "Overall Rank" factors in how many practice test(s) they have done (maybe this is problematic as maybe it might encourage user(s) to do more test(s) and maybe that means it might update the rankings more often which might mean that it might become a perfomance and/or cost issue for the developer), ]
<br></br>
<b>  </b>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<b>  </b>
<br></br>
<b>  </b> 
<br></br>
<b> Section Mental Math Speed Overview Feature (Maybe): </b> Split the section(s) up (i.e. 40s addition, 30s division, 2-digit mixed number subtraction, etc.) and create a time series graph (line chart) showing the progression of the user for that section (maybe display all of them at once and/or maybe display them as the user adds data (from practicing and/or testing) and/or a certain minimum of data (so like a certain number of practice session(s) and/or testing that involves the section [so like if the minimum is 10 attempts for 40s addition and the user does 5 practice session(s) and/or test(s) but only gets and attempts 7 problems involving 40s addition throughout those 5 practice session(s) and/or test(s) then the time series graph for that section will not be displayed but if the user gets and attempts 13 problems involving 40s addition then the time series graph will be added to the section] (this is a maybe though).
<br></br>
<b> Arithmetic Operation Frequency Heatmap Feature (Maybe): </b> A chart that shows relative performance frequencies (i.e. how a user is doing on 70's + 40's addition, 20's times a mixed number fraction, etc.) as a heatmap. </b>
<br></br>
<b> High Score Website Feature (Maybe): </b> Maybe allow user(s) to create an account in the application and then maybe allow them to submit their high score to an online leaderboard.
<br></br>
<b> Competition Feature (Maybe): </b> Maybe allow user(s) to play against each other (maybe on the same network and/or on different network(s)).
<br></br>
User Overall (Raw) & Overall Average (Raw) Stats (maybe display an overall rank (e.g. 46/23806) and/or maybe an overall average rank (e.g. 2536/23806) and maybe a graph displaying where they rank beneath it (e.g. vertical bar chart showing overall rank percentile (in one color and maybe display another but for raw (in another color)) and maybe another vertical bar chart (in a different color) displaying their overall average percentile (maybe add another (in a different color) displaying raw))). Then maybe on the other half (maybe top half) you display best category performance and worst category performance. Maybe below it you display an attendance calender for the month and maybe a see more button in the bottom right corner.

<h1>Thing(s) To Think About:</h1>
<br></br>
⦿ How will you get this to work offline?
<br></br>
⦿ How will you allow user(s) to sign in (regular username and/or password? O-auth? Will it be stored on the mobile device and/or web application)?
<br></br>
⦿ How will the data transfer to a leaderboard for all user(s) to see (how will you verify the data is correct and belongs to the user)?
<br></br>
⦿ How will you test the code?
<br></br>
⦿ How will you organize the code 
<ul>
<li>[folder(s), file name(s), etc.], </li>
<li>[dist?, </li>
<li>build folder [for all file(s) but maybe in a minified version]?, </li>
<li>frontend (src folder inside)?, styles folder?, test/test(s) folder?, etc.)?, </li>
<li>backend (src folder inside?)?, </li>
<li>test/test(s) folder?, theme(s), 
<li>README.md file for theme(s) (like how to create & submit them to be accepted within the parameters of the application and/or maybe what can, currently, be changed on the application), </li>
<li>mathcalc (addition file?, subtraction file?, multiplication file?, division file?, etc.)?, </li>
<li>randomization file?, </li>
<li>sectionalrandomization (40s addition, 80s & mixed number multiplication, 200-235's & 4.3-8.7 division)? etc.]?
</ul>
<br></br>
⦿ Folders: 
<br></br>
[dist]
<br></br>
[frontend][src][styles (layout.css <- columns/rows/templateareas/etc.)]
<br></br>
[backend][src][styles]
<br></br>
⦿ Maybe think about adding a Things to Think About Section to every README.md in this repository and maybe an invitation to contribute to it (maybe to incentivize user(s) to contribute)
